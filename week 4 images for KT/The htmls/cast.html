                    <p> The protagonist and everyones favorite fearless hero of the film signified by his trademark rapier, hat, boots, and bravado! 
                        Despite obvious setbacks in terms of attitude, behavior, and ego he showcases the importance of steadfast determination and bravery 
                        even in the face of change.

                    <p> The Love Interest and Deuteragonist of the film, known for her silent thievery, skill with a small blade, and of course her <i>soft paws</i> 
                        She showcases an importance on trust and what it means to earn it. In the film she is often shown being contempt with Puss, after an open-ended ending 
                        in the first film. It doesn't seem like the relationship between Puss and Kitty has blossomed in the interim. </p>

                    <p> The Confidant and Deuteragonist of the film, Perrito is an ecclectic and hilarious bundle of energy that never stops giving. He proves to be the 
                        the emotional and moral compass he's designed to be. Perrito also showcases a very important and special moment in the film in which he acts as 
                        a therapy dog to help Puss come out of his panic attack.</p>

                    <p> Wagner Moura's 'The Big Bad Wolf' plays the role of a foil character to it's utmost essence. He's not being touted as the greatest Dreamworks
                        villain to be made ever for nothing. The Big Bad Wolf is as his name states, <b>Big</b> and <b><i>Bad</i></b>. He plays the most important role
                        in the entirety of the film. In which he's meant to help Puss In Boots reconcile with his past lives and grow as a person. But not once in the 
                        film does he ever indicate he's a positive influence. The major reveal towards the latter half of the movie for this character had me gobsmacked.
                        Truly a brilliant performance, and character.  </p>

                    <p> Voiced by: <i>Florence Pugh</i> </p>
                    <p> The Primary head of the proverbial comedic relief Hydra that is Goldilocks and the Three Bears. This troupe of Bounty Hunter wannabe's crossed with 
                        Crime Family hopefuls continuously butts into the thick of it during the movie. Once in search of Puss to help them find the wish in which they destroy 
                        a house. Another time in which kidnap a dog. And a third where someone close to the lot of them nearly goes down. Goldi plays a strange role where the troupe 
                        has their own sideline story, almost a B plot really. Goldi plays the tertiary protagonist to this effect and much like Puss needs to learn a very valuable lesson.
                        Sometimes the thing you're wishing for most, is something you already have.

                    <p> The Brilliant performance of Papa Bear and his dichotomy between being the goofy dad and stalwart protector of the family is done masterfully by Ray Winstone.
                        As aforementioned in Goldilocks about section Papa Bear is a part of the comedic tertiary troupe. He's a loveable, big, somewhat dumb, oaf who just captivates your
                        heart in the simplicity of his joys. At one point during a fight he's kicked in the jaw and sent flying into a rocking chair with a bowl of porridge where <i>mid fight</i>
                        he eats a bowl of porridge and starts to take a nap. He's just simply great.

                    <p> The epitome of straight or round character in which she is the gravitational pull of the troupe. The force that keeps them together. She often times is seen
                        as being the agreeable and caring mother. She doesn't cause much of a stir in the dialogue until the near end of the movie but in that one single instance of speech
                        she's able to rend the heart from your chest. It's in this moment we see the true sacrifice of a mothers love for her childs dream. It can seriously make you cry. And
                        it's both impressive and strange, since this is the tertiary cast you don't expect such powerful moments to come from them. But for a group of bears they truly come 
                        across as the most human.

                    <p> It feels like Baby Bear is a joke character. And that's good, because he is. And that's a good thing because you need dichotomy between characters. If the bears are a 
                        troupe of clowns Baby Bear is the sad one that even the regular clowns laugh at. Between his mannerisms and speech it's clear to tell that the writers made Baby Bear to 
                        be so outrageous he's funny. In the same breath they've made him relatively one-note. In moments of emotional turmoil the work is carried by the animator because the writers
                        didn't give the VA enough to work with. He's very one dimensional. And that should be bad. But it's because of this, we find him so endearing. And why his big moment in the Film
                        is a real tear jeaker.

                    <p> Typing <i>Crazy Cat Lady</i> and nothing else would actually be a very apt character description and I think you'd completely understand Mama Luna off that. 
                        But crazy is underselling it. It's almost prison like conditions for these cats. We watch her break Puss in Boots very spirit and get him into a routine. 
                        It's as funny as it is heartbreaking, because Puss in Boots not only looks sad.. she changes his name to Pickles. Which is used for some very clever call back 
                        jokes later on. But essentially <b>CRAZY CAT LADY</b>.</p>

                    <p> Like the majority of stock characters in Dreamworks films the Doctor is just slightly not all there in the Cabeza. And that's the extent of his dimensionality.
                        he's got a bit of humor to him but, of course, he's a Doctor and as such is meant to give you the news. Good or bad. In this case The Doctor is used to set up
                        the main conflict of the film and give Puss the extent of the stakes. He's a good background character that gets his moment and never shows up again.  </p>
