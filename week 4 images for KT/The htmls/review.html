                <p> My Review on <em> Puss in Boots the Last Wish</em></p>

                <p> While animation has been on the rise in the past few years, in terms of film quality animation we've seldom seen anything like this come from somewhere
                    other than Japan. With recent hits like Demon Slayer: Mugen Train, One Piece Film Red, and Jujutsu Kaisen 0 it's a tall order to come fresh faced to the table
                    with the first Shrek-universe film in 11 years. The film begins in classic Shrek fashion with the start of a fairytale, this time.. being the "wish upon a star" fairytale.
                    It's a trope well played by the directors as this fairytale also plays as the main goal for the film, to recieve and make the one mythical wish. Now when being faced with 
                    such a polarizing character like Puss in Boots it can become hard to have the audience empathize with him, he's so grandeous and is larger than life in his delivery. 
                    That being said, having him die within the first 15 minutes of the film is not only hilarious, but reminds us (and puss) that he is mortal. It's at this point Puss learns 
                    he is on his last life, and as such must retire from being a hero. In his denile we are introduced to one of the absolute coldest villains to emerge from a dreamworks studio
                    film ever. The big bad wolf. He instills a fear of mortality into puss and causes him to run. Through this series of events he meets a new friend (Perrito), reunites with an old flame (Kitty)
                    and makes some new rivals and enemies (Goldilocks and the 3 bears, as well as Jack Horner respectively). The dynamic played between the many factions never feels dull or 
                    forced. There are parts of the movie where they have to interact with eachother that just come across as so human. One such instance is when Perrito is kidnapped by Goldilocks and the 3 bears. 
                    They have a roast session between Goldi and baby bear, which escalates to Perrito roasting the lot of them. After which they're all a bit more chummy together and Perrito tells
                    Goldi that she's "Won the orphan lottery". Very human speech for an animated dog to be giving. But that's just a taste of the general dialogue offered in the film. 
                    Puss in Boots: The Last Wish does an amazing job at drawing out the empathy from it's audience and having it be shared amongst all the characters (Not Jack). 
                    If I had to give it a rating in relation to all film, it is a very solid 8/10. If I had to rate it only against other animated movies this is a clear 10/10 and should have taken
                    the title of "Best Animated Film of 2022".
